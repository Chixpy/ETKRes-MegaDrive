RISK is a conversion of the popular strategy board game created by Parker Brothers. Players control armies placed in different regions of the world, attacking opposing players' armies to gain territory, and ultimately try to wipe out the other factions and take over the world. In addition to the regular classic mode, which works just like the original board game, there is also an arcade mode where skirmishes between factions give the player direct control of cannons to attack the opposing player. Any combination of up to six human and computer players can compete for world domination.
