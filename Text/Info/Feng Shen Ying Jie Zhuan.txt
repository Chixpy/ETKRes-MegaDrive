Fengshen Yingjiezhuan translated as The Heroic Legend of God-Sealing is a Chinese strategy role-playing game based on a famous legend from the time of Shang dynasty (1766-1050 BC). Zhou was the name of the last emperor of the dynasty. One day he visited the palace of the goddess Nü Wa and enchanted by her beauty commanded his generals to capture her. The generals told him there was a mortal woman in the empire whose beauty matched that of Nü Wa. After prolonged searching the Emperor's men found the girl and brought her to the palace. What they did not know was that the girl's body was possessed by a fox spirit. Since she became Emperor Zhou's wife evil has entered the empire. It is time for the great heroes of China to free the country from the corrupted Zhou and his possessed wife!

You take control first of one of the heroes, Lin Yun, and gradually re-unite with the other eight. The game is a strategy RPG which consists of battles and cut scenes to advance the story. You can only move during battles, or travel between locations via a world map. During the battles, you move your heroes over the top-down battle field, attack enemies physically, defend, or use magic whenever enemies are in your range. You gain experience points every time you attack an enemy, so it is possible to level up in the middle of a battle.
