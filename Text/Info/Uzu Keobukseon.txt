In the year 2020, the computer controlling the world has been corrupted by a virus and is out of control. Scentists create a warship, the 
Space
Turtle
Battleship"
to
fight
against
it.
Two
young
pilots
Titi
and
Koti
take
the
helm
and
blast
off
to
fight
the
out-of-control
computer."

Uju Geobukseon (
Space
Turtle
Battleship")
is
a
vertically-scrolling
shooter
in
which
the
player
controls
the
titular
battleship.
Like
most
any
scrolling
shooter
the
player
must
shoot
down
various
enemies
without
allowing
the
ship
to
be
hit
and
destroyed
and
there
is
a
large
boss
waiting
at
the
end
of
each
stage.
The
ship
has
two
different
modes
of
fire
which
will
shoot
in
different
directions;
if
three
power-ups
are
collected
the
number
of
bullets
fired
will
increase.
There
are
three
difficulty
settings
available."
