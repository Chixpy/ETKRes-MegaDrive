Satoru Nakajima, the first Japanese driver to race full-time in Formula 1, licensed this racing game which combines arcade and simulation elements. The full 1991 season is recreated, with the chance to do individual races or a full season. Before the race you can modify several areas of the car set-up, including engine performance (configurations with higher top speed have slower acceleration), wing downforce (higher top speed means lower grip), tyres (better grip means lower durability) and so on.

The action is viewed from above, with the track viewed at a fixed angle rather than rotating. You can do practice sessions as well as the actual racing.
