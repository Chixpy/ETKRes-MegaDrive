J.League Champion Soccer is a modified version of World Trophy Soccer featuring an official J.League license and all ten 1993 season J.League teams, including player names. The game lacks the color edit mode of the other versions, and only contains the ten teams from the Japan League, but otherwise plays the same, including the option for a tournament of up to eight players.
